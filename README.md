# 🏀 St. T’s MSR Leaderboard — CYO 2025
Modern Skill Rating (MSR) tracking system for the **St. T’s CYO Basketball Program (2025 season)**.

This project provides a simple, transparent, and team-centered way to measure complete player contributions beyond scoring — including effort, efficiency, rebounding, playmaking, defense, and overall impact on winning.

The leaderboard updates from a CSV dataset and displays a clean, mobile-friendly UI designed for players and families to follow along throughout the season.

## 📊 What Is MSR?
**MSR = Modern Skill Rating**, a composite stat designed to measure:

- Hustle  
- Efficiency  
- Rebounding  
- Playmaking  
- Defensive contributions  
- Turnover avoidance  
- Overall impact per minute  

> **MSR is NOT a ranking system.**  
> It is a *development tool* to help players understand all the ways they contribute to the team — not just scoring.

Color coding helps players quickly see growth areas:

| MSR Range | Meaning      | Color     |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 35+      | Elite        | Cardinal Red |
| 15–34    | Strong       | Amber |
| <15      | Developing   | Gray |
